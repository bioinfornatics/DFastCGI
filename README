BUILD
------
run build.sh script as
$ ./build.sh

use -h paramter for more info
$ ./build.sh -h

INSTALL
-------
It is quite easy after building just copy:
$ su -c 'cp -r install/* /'


If you build as shared lib remember to run ldconfig:
    If you have used default prefix
    $ su -c 'ldconfig /usr/local/lib'

    If you have set lib dir as lib64
    $ su -c 'ldconfig /usr/local/lib64'

    If you have set prefix as /usr
    $ su -c 'ldconfig'

EXAMPLES
--------
for build and test example you need link to your fastcgi library. I assume DFastCGI lib is build with ldc:
$ ldc2 -O -g -w -I=/usr/local/include/d/DFastCGI/ -L-lDFastCGI-ldc -L-lfcgi test_fcgiapp.d
$ su -c 'install -o lighthttpd test_fcgiapp.fcgi /var/www/cgi-bin/test_fcgiapp.fcgi'
    Do not works:
    ------------
    * test_fcgi_stdio.d
    * test_thread_fcgiapp.d (maybe ldc issue)
    * test_request.d and test_fcgi_application.d isuspect for same reason around D to C interface


PROBLEMS
--------
If your application fail during build because it do not found symbol provides by this library you could do:
 # ldd /path/to/lib/libDFastCGI.so
 # ldconfig /path/to/libdir/


LOGGING
--------
You can enable logging by using one of this commands:
 $ export DFASTCGI_DEBUG=TRUE
 $ export DFASTCGI_DEBUG=true
 $ export DFASTCGI_DEBUG=1
